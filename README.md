# ToDoList (Text-Based)
This is a simple Python console application for managing a personal to-do list. Users can add new tasks, view all current tasks, and remove tasks once completed. The app runs in a loop, allowing users to keep updating their list until they choose to exit. Itâ€™s a great beginner project to practice working with lists, loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.

__**Features:**__

-Add new tasks to your list

-View all current tasks, neatly numbered

-Remove tasks by selecting their number

-Runs entirely in the terminal with no external libraries required

__**Possible Enhancements:**__

-Save and load tasks from a file

-Add task priorities or due dates

-Mark tasks as completed instead of removing them

-Create a graphical user interface (GUI)

-Would you like it shorter, more detailed, or formatted differently?
